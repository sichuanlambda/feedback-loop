  "Art Deco" => {
    era: "1920s–1940s",
    origin: "France, United States",
    tagline: "Where geometry meets glamour",
    intro: "Art Deco is one of the most visually distinctive architectural styles of the 20th century. Born from a desire to celebrate modernity, technological progress, and luxury, it transformed cityscapes around the world with its bold geometric forms, lavish materials, and unmistakable sense of confidence. From the soaring skyscrapers of Manhattan to the pastel-hued hotels of Miami Beach, Art Deco buildings command attention and admiration nearly a century after their creation.",
    history: "The style takes its name from the 1925 Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes in Paris, though its roots extend back to the pre-war experiments of Viennese and French designers. In the United States, Art Deco became the language of aspiration during the Roaring Twenties and persisted through the Depression era, when streamlined variants emerged. The style absorbed influences from ancient Egyptian art (spurred by the 1922 discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb), Cubism, Futurism, and indigenous American motifs, fusing them into a cosmopolitan aesthetic that felt simultaneously ancient and futuristic.",
    characteristics: [
      "Bold geometric patterns and angular forms",
      "Stepped or ziggurat-like profiles and setback massing",
      "Rich materials: chrome, marble, exotic woods, lacquer, and terracotta",
      "Stylized natural motifs — sunbursts, chevrons, fountains, and flora",
      "Vertical emphasis with strong horizontal banding",
      "Elaborate lobby interiors with murals, metalwork, and ornamental ceilings",
      "Integration of sculpture and bas-relief into facades"

      { name: "Palacio de Bellas Artes", city: "Mexico City", year: "1934" }
    ],
    why_it_matters: "Art Deco democratized beauty in architecture by bringing artistry and craftsmanship to commercial buildings, movie theaters, apartment blocks, and subway stations — not just palaces and churches. Its optimistic embrace of new materials and industrial techniques anticipated our modern world, while its insistence on ornament and delight reminds us that buildings can be joyful. Today, Art Deco districts from Miami to Mumbai are beloved heritage zones, and the style's influence echoes in contemporary design that values bold geometry and material richness.",

  "Art Nouveau" => {
    era: "1890–1910",
    origin: "Belgium, France",
    tagline: "Nature as architecture's muse",
    intro: "Art Nouveau swept through Europe like a vine climbing a trellis — organic, sinuous, and impossible to ignore. Rejecting the rigid historicism of the 19th century, architects and designers drew inspiration from the natural world: whiplash curves, flowering tendrils, insect wings, and ocean waves became the vocabulary of a style that sought to dissolve the boundaries between art, craft, and daily life.",
    history: "The movement emerged simultaneously in Brussels (where Victor Horta designed the revolutionary Hôtel Tassel in 1893), Paris, Glasgow, Vienna, and Barcelona. Known by different names across Europe — Jugendstil in Germany, Modernisme in Catalonia, Sezessionstil in Austria — it was united by a commitment to total design, where every element from the building's structure to its door handles formed a unified artistic vision. Though relatively short-lived, Art Nouveau's influence on 20th-century design was profound, anticipating organic modernism and biophilic architecture.",
    characteristics: [
      "Flowing, organic lines inspired by plant forms and natural curves",
      "Innovative use of iron, glass, and ceramic in expressive structural roles",
      "Asymmetrical facades with dynamic, almost living compositions",
      "Integration of decorative arts: stained glass, mosaic, metalwork, and ceramic tile",
      "Whiplash curves and undulating surfaces",

      { name: "Secession Building", city: "Vienna", year: "1898" }
    ],
    why_it_matters: "Art Nouveau proved that modernity need not mean coldness. By insisting that beauty, craft, and nature could coexist with innovation, it offered an alternative path that resonates strongly today as architects embrace biophilic design, organic forms, and the integration of art into everyday spaces.",

  "Baroque" => {
    era: "1600–1750",
    origin: "Italy",
    tagline: "Drama, grandeur, and divine spectacle",
    intro: "Baroque architecture is the architecture of persuasion. Emerging in Counter-Reformation Italy, it was designed to overwhelm the senses, inspire awe, and communicate the power of the Church and the state. With its bold curves, theatrical lighting, gilded surfaces, and monumental scale, Baroque architecture transformed the cities of Europe into stages for spiritual and political drama.",
    history: "The style originated in Rome around 1600, pioneered by architects like Carlo Maderno, Gian Lorenzo Bernini, and Francesco Borromini. It spread rapidly across Catholic Europe — to Spain, Portugal, Austria, and the colonial territories of Latin America — and was adapted by Protestant nations in more restrained forms. Baroque urban planning created grand plazas, sweeping avenues, and monumental fountains that remain the defining features of cities like Rome, Prague, and Vienna.",
    characteristics: [
      "Grand scale with dramatic use of light, shadow, and movement",
      "Curved walls, undulating facades, and oval floor plans",
      "Lavish ornamentation: gilding, frescoes, stucco, and sculpture",
      "Monumental staircases, domes, and colonnades",
      "Integration of architecture, painting, and sculpture into a total artwork",
      "Strong axial planning with processional sequences"

      { name: "Church of the Gesù", city: "Rome", year: "1584" }
    ],
    why_it_matters: "Baroque architecture reminds us of the emotional power of space. In an age of minimalism and efficiency, Baroque buildings demonstrate that architecture can move us, astonish us, and create experiences that transcend the purely functional. The style's mastery of theatrical space continues to inspire architects, set designers, and urban planners.",

  "Bauhaus" => {
    era: "1919–1933",
    origin: "Germany",
    tagline: "Form follows function, art meets industry",
    intro: "The Bauhaus was more than an architectural style — it was a revolution in how we think about design. Founded by Walter Gropius in Weimar, Germany in 1919, the Bauhaus school sought to unify art, craft, and technology to create a new aesthetic for the modern industrial age. Its architectural legacy — clean lines, flat roofs, white walls, and glass curtain walls — became the template for modernism worldwide.",
    history: "The school moved from Weimar to Dessau in 1925, where Gropius designed the iconic Bauhaus building with its revolutionary glass curtain wall. Under successive directors — Gropius, Hannes Meyer, and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe — the school refined its approach to functional design. When the Nazis closed the Bauhaus in 1933, its masters emigrated to the United States, Britain, and Israel, spreading its principles across the globe. Tel Aviv's White City, built largely by Bauhaus-trained architects, contains the world's largest collection of Bauhaus buildings.",
    characteristics: [
      "Flat roofs and smooth, unadorned facades",
      "Asymmetrical compositions based on function",
      "Open floor plans with flexible interior spaces",
      "Steel, glass, and reinforced concrete as primary materials",
      "Ribbon windows and glass curtain walls",
      "Primary colors used as accents against white surfaces",

      { name: "Tel Aviv White City", city: "Tel Aviv", year: "1930s" }
    ],
    why_it_matters: "The Bauhaus transformed design education, established the foundations of modern graphic design, furniture design, and architecture, and proved that good design could be democratic — available to everyone, not just the wealthy. Its principles of clarity, functionality, and the unity of art and technology remain the bedrock of design education worldwide.",

  "Beaux-Arts" => {
    era: "1880s–1920s",
    origin: "France",
    tagline: "Classical grandeur for the modern age",
    intro: "Beaux-Arts architecture represents the pinnacle of academic classical design. Taught at the prestigious École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, this style combined Greek and Roman architectural forms with Renaissance planning principles and modern engineering to create buildings of extraordinary grandeur. In America, Beaux-Arts became the chosen style for institutions that wanted to project permanence, culture, and civic pride.",
    history: "American architects who studied in Paris — including Richard Morris Hunt, Charles McKim, and Daniel Burnham — brought the Beaux-Arts approach back to the United States, where it flourished from the 1880s through the 1920s. The 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, with its gleaming 'White City,' established Beaux-Arts as the style of American aspiration. Grand railway stations, public libraries, museums, and government buildings across the country adopted its monumental vocabulary.",
    characteristics: [

  "Brutalism" => {
    era: "1950s–1970s",
    origin: "United Kingdom",
    tagline: "Raw concrete, radical honesty",
    intro: "No architectural style provokes stronger reactions than Brutalism. Its massive concrete forms, raw textures, and uncompromising geometry inspire fierce devotion and visceral dislike in roughly equal measure. Born from postwar idealism and a belief that architecture could reshape society, Brutalism produced some of the 20th century's most powerful and controversial buildings.",
    history: "The term derives from the French béton brut (raw concrete), championed by Le Corbusier in his Unité d'Habitation in Marseille (1952). In Britain, architects Alison and Peter Smithson theorized 'New Brutalism' as an ethical stance: honest expression of materials and structure, rejection of prettiness, and commitment to social housing and civic infrastructure. The style spread worldwide, becoming the default for universities, government buildings, and social housing complexes from London to São Paulo to Chandigarh.",
    characteristics: [
      "Exposed raw concrete (béton brut) as the primary material",
      "Massive, sculptural geometric forms",
      "Bold structural expression — the building's bones are visible",
      "Repetitive modular elements creating rhythmic patterns",
      "Elevated structures on pilotis, with covered walkways",
      "Minimal surface decoration — texture comes from formwork patterns"

      { name: "Unité d'Habitation", city: "Marseille", year: "1952" }
    ],
    why_it_matters: "Brutalism's radical honesty challenged architecture's tendency toward concealment and decoration. Today, a growing preservation movement celebrates Brutalist buildings as bold artistic statements and important social artifacts. The style's emphasis on structural expression and material truth continues to influence contemporary architects who reject superficiality.",

  "Byzantine" => {
    era: "330–1453",
    origin: "Eastern Roman Empire",
    tagline: "Heaven on earth, rendered in mosaic and dome",
    intro: "Byzantine architecture created some of the most awe-inspiring interior spaces in human history. For over a millennium, the architects of the Eastern Roman Empire perfected the art of enclosing vast spaces with soaring domes, then covering every surface with shimmering gold mosaics that dissolved the boundary between the earthly and the divine.",
    history: "The style emerged when Emperor Constantine established Constantinople (modern Istanbul) as the new capital of the Roman Empire in 330 AD. It reached its zenith under Emperor Justinian, whose architects Anthemius of Tralles and Isidorus of Miletus created the Hagia Sophia (537 AD) — a building so extraordinary that it remained the world's largest cathedral for nearly a thousand years. Byzantine architectural principles spread throughout the Orthodox Christian world, influencing churches in Russia, Greece, the Balkans, and beyond.",

    era: "1880s–1910s",
    origin: "United States",
    tagline: "The birth of the skyscraper",
    intro: "The Chicago School gave the world the modern skyscraper. After the Great Fire of 1871 leveled much of the city, Chicago became a laboratory for architectural innovation. Engineers and architects developed steel-frame construction, enabling buildings to rise far beyond the limits of load-bearing masonry. The result was a new building type that would reshape the skylines of cities worldwide.",
    history: "Architects like William Le Baron Jenney, Daniel Burnham, John Root, and Louis Sullivan pioneered steel-frame construction and the 'Chicago window' — a large fixed pane flanked by narrower operable sashes. Sullivan's dictum 'form follows function' became the rallying cry of modern architecture. The Home Insurance Building (1885), often called the first skyscraper, used a metal frame to support its walls, fundamentally changing how buildings were conceived and constructed.",

    intro: "Classical architecture is the foundation upon which Western architecture stands. Developed in ancient Greece and refined by the Romans, its principles of symmetry, proportion, and the columnar orders have been studied, adapted, and reinterpreted for over 2,500 years. From the Parthenon to the Lincoln Memorial, classical forms communicate permanence, dignity, and universal ideals.",
    history: "The Greeks developed three columnar orders — Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian — each with specific proportional relationships between base, shaft, capital, and entablature. The Romans added the Tuscan and Composite orders and revolutionized construction with the arch, vault, and concrete, enabling buildings of unprecedented scale like the Pantheon and the Colosseum. After the fall of Rome, classical principles were preserved in treatises by Vitruvius and revived during the Renaissance, ensuring their influence would span millennia.",

    intro: "Colonial architecture tells the story of cultural transplantation — European settlers bringing familiar building traditions to unfamiliar lands and adapting them to new climates, materials, and social conditions. From the clapboard houses of New England to the haciendas of Mexico, Colonial buildings reflect the meeting of cultures and the forging of new identities.",
    history: "Each colonial power left a distinctive architectural legacy. British colonists built symmetrical Georgian houses with central hallways; the Spanish created thick-walled adobe structures with interior courtyards; the Dutch built steep-gabled brick houses; and the French developed the raised Creole cottage. Over time, these imported forms were modified by local conditions — wider porches for hotter climates, different materials where European supplies were unavailable — creating distinctly American, Latin American, and Asian architectural traditions.",

What unites contemporary work is an emphasis on sustainability, digital fabrication, material innovation, and designs that respond thoughtfully to their specific sites and communities.",
    history: "The term 'contemporary' distinguishes current architectural practice from the historical 'Modern' movement. Where modernism sought universal solutions, contemporary architecture embraces pluralism. The rise of computational design tools, parametric modeling, and Building Information Modeling (BIM) has expanded the formal possibilities of architecture, while the climate crisis has made sustainable design an ethical imperative rather than an optional feature.",

Inspired by the philosophical writings of Jacques Derrida and the visual experiments of Russian Constructivism, deconstructivist architects created buildings that appear fragmented, disjointed, and dynamically unstable. These are structures that challenge our assumptions about what buildings can look like and how they should behave.",
    history: "The movement was crystallized by Philip Johnson and Mark Wigley's 1988 exhibition 'Deconstructivist Architecture' at MoMA, which featured seven architects: Frank Gehry, Daniel Libeskind, Rem Koolhaas, Peter Eisenman, Zaha Hadid, Coop Himmelb(l)au, and Bernard Tschumi.

    intro: "Edwardian architecture represents a graceful transition between the ornate complexity of the Victorian era and the stripped-down modernism that would follow. Named for King Edward VII's brief reign, the style brought more light, space, and classical restraint to British domestic and commercial architecture, creating buildings that feel airy and elegant without Victorian excess.",
    history: "The Edwardian era was shaped by technological advances — electric lighting, improved plumbing, and better glass manufacturing — that allowed architects to design rooms with larger windows and more open plans. The style blended elements of Baroque Revival, Arts and Crafts, and Art Nouveau, creating a distinctive English character. Edwardian suburbs, with their wide tree-lined streets and spacious semi-detached houses, remain some of the most desirable residential areas in British cities.",

    history: "Robert Venturi's 'Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture' (1966) and 'Learning from Las Vegas' (1972) provided the intellectual foundation, arguing that modernism's puritanical rejection of ornament and historical reference had impoverished architecture. Charles Jencks declared modernism dead in 1977 when the Pruitt-Igoe housing project was demolished.

    history: "Frank Lloyd Wright developed the Prairie style while working from his Oak Park studio, producing a series of revolutionary houses between 1900 and 1910 — including the Robie House, the Dana-Thomas House, and the Ward W.

British architect Richard Norman Shaw developed the original 'Queen Anne' style in the 1870s, blending medieval and classical elements. American architects took the name but created something far more exuberant — a free-form picturesque style that became the most popular house type in America during the 1880s and 1890s, aided by the mass production of decorative millwork and the expansion of the railroad.",
