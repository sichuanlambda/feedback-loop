# Virtual Tour Feature

## Overview

The Virtual Tour feature allows users to experience a curated selection of buildings in a card-based interface, cycling through each building one at a time. This provides an immersive way to explore architectural analyses without having to navigate between individual pages.

## How It Works

### Starting a Virtual Tour

1. Navigate to any place page (e.g., `/places/denver`)
2. Click the "Virtual Tour" button in the tour planning component
3. Select the buildings you want to include in your tour
4. Click "Start Virtual Tour"

### Virtual Tour Interface

The virtual tour modal provides:

- **Building Cards**: Each card displays:
  - Building image
  - Address and city
  - Architectural styles (up to 5 shown)
  - Analysis preview (truncated content)
  - "View Full Analysis" button to see complete details

- **Navigation Controls**:
  - Previous/Next buttons
  - Auto-advance toggle (8 seconds per building)
  - Pause/Resume functionality
  - Progress bar showing tour completion

- **Keyboard Navigation**:
  - Left/Right arrows: Navigate between buildings
  - Spacebar: Toggle auto-advance
  - Escape: Close tour modal

- **Tour Information**:
  - Current building number and total count
  - Tour timer
  - Download tour summary option

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

- `app/views/places/show.html.erb`: Main implementation
  - Added virtual tour modal
  - Added CSS styles for building cards
  - Added JavaScript for tour functionality
  - Updated JSON data to include HTML content

### Key Features

1. **Card-Based Experience**: Buildings are displayed in beautiful, responsive cards
2. **Smooth Animations**: Slide-in/slide-out animations between buildings
3. **Auto-Advance**: Automatic progression through buildings with pause/resume
4. **Keyboard Support**: Full keyboard navigation for accessibility
5. **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bar and building counter
6. **Tour Summary**: Downloadable JSON summary of the tour
7. **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

### Data Flow

1. Building analyses are loaded with HTML content included
2. User selects buildings in the tour planning modal
3. Selected buildings are passed to the virtual tour
4. Each building card is dynamically generated with:
   - Image, address, styles
   - Truncated HTML content (500 characters)
   - Link to full analysis page

## Usage Examples

### For Users

- **Quick Overview**: Get a rapid overview of multiple buildings
- **Presentation Mode**: Use auto-advance for presentations
- **Detailed Exploration**: Click "View Full Analysis" for complete details
- **Tour Planning**: Preview buildings before planning physical tours

### For Content Creators

- **Content Curation**: Create themed tours of specific architectural styles
- **Educational Content**: Build educational sequences of buildings
- **Marketing**: Showcase the best buildings in a location

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the virtual tour feature:

1. **Tour Templates**: Pre-built tours for different architectural styles
2. **Audio Narration**: Add audio descriptions for each building
3. **Social Sharing**: Share tours on social media
4. **Tour Ratings**: Allow users to rate and review tours
5. **Custom Timing**: Adjustable auto-advance timing
6. **Fullscreen Mode**: Immersive fullscreen experience
7. **Tour Bookmarks**: Save favorite tours for later viewing

## Browser Compatibility

The virtual tour feature works in all modern browsers that support:
- ES6 JavaScript features
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- CSS animations and transitions
- Bootstrap 5 modals

## Performance Considerations

- Building images are loaded on-demand
- HTML content is truncated to prevent performance issues
- Auto-advance is cleared when modal is closed to prevent memory leaks
- Keyboard event listeners are only active when modal is open
